> Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, do you think that the accessibility problems are all solvable? Why or why not?

Even that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, there are limits and optimizations we can add to enforce accessibilty (like the filters on reddit to cover flashing images or sensitive content).

> Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

It would be usable. But the images/icons really messes with the flow, and the lack of parallel display really haults usability.

> Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why or why not?

It would be useable. The images have alt texts which could still provide guidance for user clicking, but it would be really painful.
